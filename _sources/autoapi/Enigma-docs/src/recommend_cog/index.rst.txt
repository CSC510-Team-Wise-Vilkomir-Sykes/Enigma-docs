   What:
       The `recommend_cog` module introduces the `RecommendCog` class, a Discord bot cog tailored for song recommendations and polling based on user preferences. It facilitates interactive commands that allow users to participate in song selection polls and receive personalized music recommendations, enhancing the musical engagement within a Discord server.

   Why:
       In the vibrant environment of Discord communities, music plays a pivotal role in fostering engagement and camaraderie. The `RecommendCog` empowers users to collaboratively curate playlists, discover new genres, and personalize their listening experience. By leveraging user interactions and preferences, it creates a dynamic and responsive music recommendation system that keeps the community lively and engaged.

   How:
       - **/poll Command**: Users invoke the `/poll` command to initiate a poll where they are presented with a list of 10 randomly selected songs spanning various genres. Each song is associated with a unique emoji. Users can react to the message with the corresponding emojis to select up to 3 songs they prefer. These selections are then used to tailor future recommendations.

       - **/recommend Command**: Based on the songs selected through the `/poll` command, users can invoke the `/recommend` command to receive personalized song suggestions. The bot generates a list of recommended songs that align with the genres of the user's favorites. Users can interact with these recommendations by adding songs to their queue or requesting a new set of suggestions, ensuring a continuously evolving and personalized music experience.

       Example Use Cases:
           1. **Community Playlist Building**: Facilitate the creation of a community-driven playlist where members can vote on their favorite songs, ensuring the playlist reflects the collective taste of the group.
           2. **Music Discovery**: Help users explore new music by recommending tracks that align with their existing preferences, broadening their musical horizons.
           3. **Event Hosting**: Enhance virtual events or game nights with curated music selections that keep participants engaged and entertained.

   Classes:
       RecommendCog(commands.Cog):
           Encapsulates the song recommendation and polling commands, managing user interactions, song selections, and the generation of personalized recommendations.

   Functions:
       - poll(ctx):
           Initiates a song selection poll where users can choose their preferred songs by reacting with emojis. Facilitates up to 3 song selections to personalize future recommendations.

       - recommend(ctx):
           Generates and presents personalized song recommendations based on the user's previous selections from the poll. Allows users to add recommended songs to their queue or request new recommendations.

       - generate_recommendations(selected_songs):
           Processes the user's selected songs to generate a tailored list of up to 10 song recommendations, focusing on the genres of the chosen tracks while ensuring diversity in artists.

   Dependencies:
       - discord.py: For creating and managing bot commands, handling message interactions, and managing embeds and reactions.
       - asyncio: For managing asynchronous events, particularly waiting for user reactions in real-time.
       - pandas: For efficient management and manipulation of song data within DataFrames.
       - BotState: A custom module to maintain the current state of selected songs across different bot sessions and commands.
       - utils: Contains helper functions, including `random_25` for selecting random song recommendations.

   Usage:
       To integrate the `RecommendCog` into your Discord bot, add it to your bot instance as shown below. This will enable the polling and recommendation features within your Discord server.

       Example:
           ```python
           from recommend_cog import RecommendCog

           bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="/")
           bot.add_cog(RecommendCog(bot))
           bot.run('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN')
           ```

   .. rubric:: Notes

   - The module assumes the existence of a `Song` class, which encapsulates essential track metadata such as track name, artist, and genre.
   - It relies on the `get_all_songs` and `get_songs_by_genre` functions to fetch and filter songs from the dataset.
   - Ensure that the dependencies (`discord.py`, `asyncio`, `pandas`, `BotState`, and `utils`) are correctly installed and configured in your project environment.

   .. py:attribute:: bot


   .. py:method:: poll(ctx)
      :async:


      What:
          The `/poll` command presents users with a list of 10 randomly selected songs from various genres. Users can select up to 3 songs they prefer by reacting with corresponding emojis.

      Why:
          This interactive poll allows the bot to gather user preferences, which are essential for generating personalized song recommendations that align with the user's taste.

      How:
          - Sends a message prompting users to react with number emojis corresponding to their favorite songs.
          - Displays a list of 10 songs with associated emojis.
          - Waits for the user to react to the message, capturing up to 3 song selections.
          - Confirms each selection and updates the bot's state with the chosen songs.

      .. rubric:: Example

      A user types `/poll` in the Discord channel. The bot responds with a list of 10 songs, each numbered from 1Ô∏è‚É£ to üîü. The user reacts with 1Ô∏è‚É£, 3Ô∏è‚É£, and 5Ô∏è‚É£ to select their top 3 songs, which are then used for personalized recommendations.

      :param ctx: The context of the command invocation, containing information like the channel, author, and guild.
      :type ctx: commands.Context



   .. py:method:: recommend(ctx)
      :async:


      What:
          The `/recommend` command generates and displays a list of personalized song recommendations based on the user's previously selected songs from the poll. It allows users to interact with the recommendations by adding songs to their queue or requesting new sets of suggestions.

      Why:
          By providing tailored recommendations, the bot enhances the user's music discovery experience, ensuring that suggested songs align with their established preferences and encouraging continued engagement.

      How:
          - Checks if the user has any previously selected songs. If not, prompts the user to use the `/poll` command first.
          - Generates a list of recommended songs based on the genres of the selected songs.
          - Sends an embedded message displaying the recommended songs with corresponding emojis.
          - Adds reaction emojis for each recommended song and control options (e.g., requesting new recommendations or stopping the session).
          - Listens for user reactions to either add a song to the queue, request new recommendations, or end the recommendation session.

      .. rubric:: Example

      After selecting favorite songs using `/poll`, a user invokes `/recommend`. The bot responds with a list of recommended songs. The user reacts with the emoji corresponding to a song to add it to their queue or with üÜï to get a fresh set of
      recommendations.

      :param ctx: The context of the command invocation, containing information like the channel, author, and guild.
      :type ctx: commands.Context



   .. py:method:: generate_recommendations(selected_songs)

      What:
          Generates a list of up to 10 song recommendations based on the genres of the user's selected songs.

      Why:
          To provide users with personalized song suggestions that align with their musical preferences, enhancing their discovery of new tracks within their favored genres.

      How:
          - Aggregates the genres from the selected songs.
