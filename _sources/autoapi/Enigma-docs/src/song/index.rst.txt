   What:
       The `song` module defines the `Song` class, a fundamental building block for representing individual music tracks within the application. Each `Song` instance encapsulates essential metadata, including the track name, artist name, and genre, enabling seamless integration with other components such as recommendation systems and user interfaces.

   Why:
       In any music-related application, having a robust and flexible representation of songs is crucial. The `Song` class provides a standardized way to manage and manipulate song data, facilitating features like personalized recommendations, playlist creation, and genre-based filtering. By abstracting song details into a dedicated class, the module ensures consistency, scalability, and ease of maintenance across the codebase.

   How:
       - **Creating a Song Instance**: Instantiate the `Song` class by providing the track name, and optionally, the artist name and genre. This creates a song object that can be used throughout the application.

       - **String Representation**: Utilize the `__str__` method to obtain a human-readable representation of the song, which is particularly useful for displaying song information in user interfaces or logs.

       - **Integration with Other Modules**: The `Song` class can be integrated with modules responsible for fetching song data, generating recommendations, or managing user playlists, ensuring a cohesive and interconnected system.

   Example Use Cases:
       1. **Recommendation Systems**: Utilize `Song` instances to generate and display personalized song recommendations based on user preferences and listening history.

       2. **Playlist Management**: Allow users to create, modify, and view playlists composed of `Song` objects, enabling a personalized listening experience.

       3. **Music Browsing**: Facilitate browsing and searching of songs by various attributes such as genre, artist, or track name, leveraging the structured data provided by the `Song` class.

   Classes:
       Song:
           Represents a music track with its associated details, including track name, artist name, and genre.

   Functions:
       - __init__(track_name, artist_name=None, genre=None):
           Initializes a new instance of the `Song` class with the provided track name, artist name, and genre.

       - __str__():
           Returns a formatted string representation of the song, suitable for display purposes.

   Dependencies:
       - None. The `Song` class is a standalone component that does not rely on external libraries or modules.

   Usage:
       To create a new song instance, instantiate the `Song` class with the necessary details. This instance can then be used in various parts of the application, such as adding to playlists or generating recommendations.

       Example:
           ```python
           from song import Song

           # Creating a song with all details
           song1 = Song(track_name="Imagine", artist_name="John Lennon", genre="Rock")

           # Creating a song with only track name
           song2 = Song(track_name="Bohemian Rhapsody")

           print(song1)  # Output: Imagine by John Lennon
           print(song2)  # Output: Bohemian Rhapsody
           ```

   .. rubric:: Notes

   - The `Song` class is designed to be simple and intuitive, ensuring ease of use and integration.
   - While the `artist_name` and `genre` attributes are optional, providing them enhances the functionality and applicability of the `Song` instances within the application.
   - Future extensions of the `Song` class can include additional metadata such as album name, release date, duration, and more, depending on the requirements of the application.

Module Contents
---------------

.. py:class:: Song(track_name, artist_name=None, genre=None, url=None)

   What:
       The `Song` class represents an individual music track, encapsulating its essential details such as the track name, artist name, and genre. It serves as a blueprint for creating song objects that can be utilized throughout the application for various functionalities like recommendations, playlist management, and display purposes.

   Why:
       A structured representation of songs is vital for any music-centric application. By defining a `Song` class, the module ensures that each song's data is consistently managed and easily accessible. This abstraction simplifies interactions with song data, enabling efficient processing, filtering, and display operations, thereby enhancing the overall functionality and user experience of the application.

   How:
       - **Initialization**: Create a `Song` instance by providing the track name, with optional parameters for artist name and genre. This allows for flexibility in representing songs with varying levels of detail.

       - **String Representation**: The `__str__` method provides a readable string format of the song, which can be used for displaying song information in user interfaces or logs.

       - **Integration**: `Song` instances can be integrated with other components such as databases, recommendation engines, and user interfaces, facilitating seamless data flow and interaction within the application.


   .. py:attribute:: track_name


   .. py:attribute:: artist_name


   .. py:attribute:: genre


   .. py:attribute:: url


   .. py:method:: __str__()

      What:
          Provides a human-readable string representation of the `Song` instance, formatted to include both the track name and the artist name if available.

      Why:
          A clear and concise string representation is essential for displaying song information in user interfaces, logs, and other outputs. It enhances readability and ensures that users can easily identify and differentiate between songs.

      How:
          - If the `artist_name` attribute is provided, the method returns a string in the format "`<track_name> by <artist_name>`".
          - If the `artist_name` is not provided (`None`), it returns just the `track_name`.

      .. rubric:: Example

      ```python
      song_with_artist = Song(track_name="Yesterday", artist_name="The Beatles")
      print(song_with_artist)  # Output: Yesterday by The Beatles

      song_without_artist = Song(track_name="Unknown Track")
      print(song_without_artist)  # Output: Unknown Track
      ```

      :returns: The string representation of the song.
      :rtype: str
